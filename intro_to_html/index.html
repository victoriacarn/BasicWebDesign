        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p>One way Castlevania stands out from the crowd, becoming the most popular digital series in the U.S. following its release, is through its phenomenal character creation and design. Vlad Dracula Tepes gives a refreshing spin on the cliche representation of the horror figure we are so accustomed to seeing on the screen. The depth of this character complicates his villainous origins and motives, even garnering a sense of understanding from viewers. Our main hero, Trevor Belmont, is the last living member of a of once legendary family of monster hunters. Now, with a chip on his shoulder from being cast out, he must delve back into the life he once knew to protect the people of Wallachia. Sypha Belnades is a sharp tongued, courageous magician with fascinating powers. She is the heart of this trio, keeping the fight alive and the group moving forward. Last but certainly not least we have Alucard, half human and vampire, whose struggle may be the most difficult of all.
